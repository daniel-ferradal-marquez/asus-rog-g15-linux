### Collection of Scripts I use for 2021 Asus ROG Strix G15 under Linux with systemd

I started using this laptop with Debian 12 and no upgraded to Debian 13, no flaws. Consumes much less battery under Linux, Windows just eats it.

If I start using something else I will add it here.

Note this laptop in my experience works well only with nvidia propietary driver.
